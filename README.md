### ‚Ñπ Notes on Command Usage:

- All commands marked as **Admin only** check `IsPlayerAdmin(playerid)` internally.
- `/gunmenu` can only be used:
  - If the player is within **10 units** of their team's spawn zone.
  - If the team exists (checked via `AlphaExist` or `BravoExist` flags).
- `/music` is local: only the issuing player hears the stream.
